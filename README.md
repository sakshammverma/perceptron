# Perceptron Decision Boundary Visualization

This project demonstrates how to train a perceptron on a synthetic 2D dataset and visualize its decision boundary.

## Overview

The script generates a 2D dataset with two clusters, each representing a different class. A perceptron is trained using a stochastic update rule, and its decision boundary is computed from the final weights. The original data points are then plotted based on their true labels.

## Features

- **Synthetic Dataset Generation:** Creates two clusters with distinct centers.
- **Perceptron Implementation:** Adds a bias term and updates weights using stochastic gradient updates.
- **Visualization:** Displays the original data points, overlays the perceptron decision boundary.
